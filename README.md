Water Pump Maintenance Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting maintenance needs for water pumps using sensor data. The goal is to deploy an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict operational states of water pumps, aiding in proactive maintenance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed sensor data, including normalization and feature selection.

Model Training: LSTM model trained on historical sensor data to predict pump operational states.

Flask App: Deployed a Flask application to provide real-time predictions based on the trained model.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
Flask
pandas
numpy
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-pump-maintenance.git
cd water-pump-maintenance
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the application.

Usage
Predictions: Navigate to /predict endpoint to get predictions for current pump operation.
Visualization: View historical data and predictions through the web interface.
