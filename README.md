## Overview

This project focuses on predicting maintenance needs for water pumps using sensor data. The goal is to deploy an LSTM-based deep learning model to predict operational states of water pumps, aiding in proactive maintenance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed sensor data, including normalization and feature selection.
- **Model Training**: LSTM model trained on historical sensor data to predict pump operational states.
- **Flask App**: Deployed a Flask application to provide real-time predictions based on the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- Flask
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-pump-maintenance.git
   cd water-pump-maintenance
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Usage

- **Predictions**: Navigate to `/predict` endpoint to get predictions for current pump operation.
- **Visualization**: View historical data and predictions through the web interface.
